# IllegalArgumentException in Scala Class

This example demonstrates how an `IllegalArgumentException` can be thrown in Scala when trying to set a negative value for an age property.  The `MyClass` class enforces positive ages.

## Usage

The Scala code is self-explanatory.  It creates an object and attempts to set both positive and negative ages to observe the behavior.
